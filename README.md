# Bootstrap Product Cards  
### Description  
The project loops over an array of product objects, extracts information using template literals,  
and uses that information to build product cards with Bootstrap HTML.  
The cards are built into a string and that string is printed to the page.  
Learned through this exercise that it is redundant to insert w-100 div after row of columns as columns will break naturally when they have filled their allotted number of columns.
